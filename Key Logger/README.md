# Key Logger

> Keyloggers collect information and send it back to a third party – whether that is a criminal, law enforcement or IT department. “Keyloggers are software programs that leverage algorithms that monitor keyboard strokes through pattern recognition and other techniques

> The amount of information collected by keylogger software can vary. The most basic forms may only collect the information typed into a single website or application. More sophisticated ones may record everything you type no matter the application, including information you copy and paste.
